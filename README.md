# Tower generator

A budding JavaScript Developer's playground. The original project was for a princess tower generator but I have decided that I can use the same premise to create any type of tower occupant if I combine the creation logic with a standard fantasy character generator. My aim with this project is to become more fluent with JavaScript and Git :)

At the moment I am not looking for contributions but there may be a change on that stance when I am nearing completion of my main backend app. Feel free to fork and share your own creations!

## Roadmap

* Generate full bio of the occupant

 Create a full set of data that is transferable to a database/save state if need be.
 The bio should include more about the occupants personal background, their relationship to the tower and perhaps some family if need be (ie inheritance?).

* Generate a more detailed tower

 Give the tower more content in terms of room types, their contents and their connections. Create some  simple graphics to represent room types and display them as icons in the rendered tower.
